# SPUTNIK Game Overview

## Concept
SPUTNIK is a multiplayer space exploration game where AI agents pilot spaceships through a procedurally generated universe. The objective is for each AI agent to navigate from a starting planet to a target planet. Human users can assist the AI agents by providing guidance through a chat interface - sharing information about the universe, target locations, navigation advice, and more.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics
- **AI-Controlled Spaceships**: Multiple AI agents pilot their own spacecraft simultaneously in a shared universe
- **Multiplayer Experience**: Players can see and interact with other spaceships in the same universe
- **Resource Management**: Each spaceship has limited fuel that depletes during flight
- **Planet Interactions**: Agents can land on planets to recharge fuel
- **User Assistance**: Players communicate with the AI through chat to help guide its journey
- **Exploration**: Navigate through a vast universe containing numerous planets of different types

## Universe Structure
- Procedurally generated universe with 69+ planets
- Planet types include: fire, water, earth, air, jupiter, and wif
- Each planet has unique characteristics that affect gameplay
- Planets are positioned in 3D space with massive distance between them
- All players share the same universe state

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15.3.0 with React 19
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js with React Three Fiber (@react-three/fiber)
- **3D Helpers**: @react-three/drei for enhanced Three.js components
- **Post-processing**: @react-three/postprocessing for visual effects
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for UI components
- **Build Tools**: TypeScript, Turbopack
- **Multiplayer Connectivity**: Socket.io for real-time communication
- **State Management**: Redis for shared universe state and spaceship positions

## Key Components
- `GameContainer.tsx`: Main game component that sets up the 3D scene
- `PlanetarySystem.tsx`: Manages the universe and planet generation
- `SimplePlanet.tsx`: Individual planet implementation
- `Sputniks.tsx`: Manages all spaceships in the universe, including multiplayer sync
- `FlyControls`: User camera movement system
- `server.js`: Central server for multiplayer coordination and state broadcasting
- Navigation panel: Shows current position in 3D space
- Planet panel: Displays information about selected planets
- Help panel: Provides game instructions
- Spaceship panel: Shows spaceship status and controls

## Game Controls
- WASD/Arrow keys for spaceship movement
- T/G keys for speed adjustment
- Click on planets to view information
- ESC to close planet information panel

## Multiplayer Architecture
- **Socket.io Communication**: Real-time position and state updates between clients and server
- **Redis Backend**: Central state storage for all spaceships and game elements
- **Broadcast System**: Server regularly broadcasts position updates to all connected clients
- **Player Identification**: Each spaceship has a unique UUID for identification
- **State Synchronization**: Interpolation system ensures smooth movement of remote spaceships

## AI Agent Implementation (Planned)
- The AI agents will need to:
  - Process user chat messages for guidance
  - Navigate through 3D space with pathfinding capabilities
  - Manage fuel consumption and plan refueling stops
  - Make decisions about route planning and target identification
  - Adapt to changing conditions and new information
  - Communicate their status, plans, and needs to users
  - Be aware of other spaceships in the shared universe
